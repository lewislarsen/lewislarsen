## Hey! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm Lewis, a freelance web developer specializing in PHP, mainly working on the backend of Laravel applications.  

Check out my personal site at [larsens.dev](https://larsens.dev), and feel free to reach outâ€”[lewis@larsens.dev](mailto:lewis@larsens.dev). Even if itâ€™s just to say hi, Iâ€™ll say hello right back!

My current focus is [Vanguard](https://vanguardbackup.com), a simple backup tool to make managing backups easier. You can also check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vanguardbackup).  

### Other Projects  
- A PHP web app that emails you when specific YouTube creators uploadâ€”built because I donâ€™t have a Google account but still want updates.  
- A small Old School RuneScape Java plugin that adds extra sound notifications for various in-game activities.  

Hope you enjoyed reading!
