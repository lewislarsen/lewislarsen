## Hey! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm Lewis, a freelance web developer specializing in PHP, mainly working on the backend of Laravel applications.  

Check out my personal site at [larsens.dev](https://larsens.dev), and feel free to reach outâ€”[lewis@larsens.dev](mailto:lewis@larsens.dev). Even if itâ€™s just to say hi, Iâ€™ll say hello right back!

I manage [Vanguard](https://vanguardbackup.com), a simple backup tool with a focus on ease of use (also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vanguardbackup)), and develop a [YouTube Channel Notifier](https://github.com/lewislarsen/youtube-channel-notifier) web app that sends upload notifications without requiring a Google account - both are open-source hobby projects I maintain in my spare time.

Hope you enjoyed reading!
